# ProX
Product Explorer (ProX) - Android application helping to find, compare and rate products from shops. I'd been built this project for 10 weeks (including all documents listed below) as a Bachelor Degree final project. Due to limited amount of time and diploma project standards (couldn't work in a team), I had done my best in back-end functionality and ***DIDN'T FOCUS on front-end design AT ALL***.

Documents provided below aimed to help you with navigation and understanding general concepts of ProX application.
